# Sentiment Analysis for 6 Basic Emotion with Levels Pipeline Deployment. 

In this project we clean the dataset and preprocess it to make it ready for classification for 6 basic emotions with three different levels for each emotion i.e. for each emotion levels are, slight emotion, just emotion, extreme emotion.

Then we implement Sentiment Analysis and then deploy the Machine Learning Pipeline and then use it for Classification of emotions. 

**The pipeline classifies 6 basic emotions returning values from 0-5 which represent emotions, namely**:

- 0: Relaxed
- 1: Anger
- 2: Fear
- 3: Happy
- 4: Sad
- 5: Surprise
